## What does this project do?

- Calculates **accumulated WAR (Wins Above Replacement) by team** in three views: batters, pitchers, and combined
- Displays **Top 10 rookies** in different categories:
  - Batters: WAR, Home Runs, AVG, RBI, Hits, OPS
  - Pitchers: WAR, Strikeouts, ERA, WHIP, Innings Pitched, Saves
- **Interactive charts** (Plotly): click on a team's bar to see a detailed list of that team's players with scrolling
- **Language selector** Spanish / English built into the dashboard

## Technologies Used

- **Python** — pandas for data cleaning and analysis
- **Streamlit** — interactive dashboard framework
- **Plotly** — interactive charts with click events
- **Jupyter Notebook** — initial data exploration and cleaning
- **Streamlit Community Cloud** — free deployment

## Known Data Limitations

This project uses data downloaded directly from Baseball-Reference, which has some important limitations to consider when interpreting results:

- **Players who played for multiple teams in the same season:** Baseball-Reference does not always break down statistics by individual team in the download format used for this project. In these cases, the player is associated with a single team (usually the last or the one with the most participation), even though part of their production (including WAR) may have occurred with another team during the same season. This can create minor distortions in the calculation of **accumulated WAR by team**, slightly favoring the team where the player's record was registered.
- **Qualification filters:** to prevent average statistics (AVG, OPS, ERA, WHIP) from being inflated by very small sample sizes, minimums were applied: at least 100 at-bats (AB ≥ 100) and at least 100 innings pitched (IP ≥ 100) before calculating the top rankings. This means that players with few appearances, even if they have impressive numbers, do not appear in those specific rankings.

These limitations do not affect accumulated total categories (Home Runs, Hits, RBI, Strikeouts, Saves, Innings Pitched), which are calculated on 100% of available data.

### Additional Note

This data is collected from players designated as rookies in their respective years according to **MLB's rookie eligibility rule** (not their debut year), which states the following:

1. A player loses rookie status if he accumulates 130 at-bats or 50 innings pitched in the majors.
2. If he spends more than 45 days on the active roster during previous seasons.

For example, Josh Sborz debuted in MLB in 2019, but his rookie year was designated by MLB as 2021.
